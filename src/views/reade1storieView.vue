<h3>  HUMANS OF NEW YORK  </h3>

<h2> Invisible Wounds </h2>

<p> I'll be partnering with <br> Headstrong Project to tell the <br> stories of American veterans from <br> the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>
    I know that many people have strong opinions about America’s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as we meet the individuals behind the uniforms, and seek to understand their stories, I’m hoping we can momentarily put those politics aside. This is a great group of people who served and sacrificed at the request of their country. And I’m very thankful that they’ve volunteered to share their stories.
